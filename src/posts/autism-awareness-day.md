My niece has Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD). But more than that, she is awesome. You don't have to be defined by your Autism. We can all help by making the world a more inclusive place. Not judging people by the way they behave, socialize, interact with the world can make a huge difference.

## What is autism?

> Autism is a lifelong developmental disability which affects how people communicate and interact with the world. One in 100 people are on the autism spectrum and there are around 700,000 autistic adults and children in the UK.
