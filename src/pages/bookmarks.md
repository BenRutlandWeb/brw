# Bookmarks

Here is a list of links that I find useful for development:

## HTTP

- [`HTTP` Statuses](https://httpstatuses.com/)

## HTML

- [`autocomplete` attribute](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/form-control-infrastructure.html#autofill)
- [`inputmode` and `autocomplete` attributes](https://better-mobile-inputs.netlify.app/)

## REGEX

- [Regex 101](https://regex101.com/)
